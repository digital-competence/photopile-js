Photopile JS
============
**Photopile JS** is a JavaScript/jQuery image gallery that simulates
a pile of photos scattered about on a surface. Thumbnail clicks remove photos
from the pile, *(enlarging them as if being picked up by the user)*, and
once in view a secondary click returns the photo to the pile.
Thumbnails are draggable, enhancing the experience by allowing photos
buried deep in the pile to be uncovered.

**Demo:** [bri.how/project/photopile/demo.html](bri.how/project/photopile/demo.html)

Usage
-----
**Include in your project:**

* jQuery
* jQuery UI
* jQuery UI Touch Punch
* photopile.css
* photopile.js
* loading.gif
* nav-sprites.png

*Reference demo.html for details*

Add gallery markup:

    <div class="photopile-wrapper">
      <ul class="photopile">
        <li>
          <a href="PATH/TO/YOUR/FULLSIZE/IMAGE">
            <img src="PATH/TO/YOUR/THUMBNAIL/IMAGE" alt="Image description" ... />
          </a>
        </li>
        <!-- Add as many list items as you require for your gallery :) -->
      </div>
    </div>
    
And script:

    PhotoPile({
      OPTION: VALUE,
      ...
    }).scatter()
    
Optionables here (with default values):

    // Thumbnails
    numLayers:          5,          // number of layers in the pile (max zindex)
    thumbOverlap:       50,         // overlap amount (px)
    thumbRotation:      45,         // maximum rotation (deg)
    thumbBorderWidth:   2,          // border width (px)
    thumbBorderColor:   'white',    // border color
    thumbBorderHover:   '#EAEAEA',  // border hover color
    draggable:          true,       // enable draggable thumbnails
     
    // Photo container
    fadeDuration:       200,        // speed at which photo fades (ms)
    pickupDuration:     500,        // speed at which photo is picked up & put down (ms)
    photoZIndex:        100,        // z-index (show above all)
    photoBorder:        10,         // border width around fullsize image
    photoBorderColor:   'white',    // border color
    showInfo:           true,       // include photo description (alt tag) in photo container
     
    // Autoplay
    autoplayGallery:    false,      // autoplay the photopile
    autoplaySpeed:      5000,       // ms
     
    // Images
    loading:            'images/loading.gif'  // path to img displayed while gallery/thumbnails loads
